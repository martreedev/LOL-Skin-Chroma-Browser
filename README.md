# LOL-Skin-Chroma-Browser
LOL Chroma Browser lets you visually browse League of Legends champion skins and chromas. Drag a “super folder” to list champions, click to see their chromas, and view images. Clicking an image opens its corresponding file. Supports search, scrolling, and handles invalid folders gracefully.
